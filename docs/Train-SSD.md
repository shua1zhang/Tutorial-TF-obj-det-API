## Train SSD model with Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset

This part of tutorial will demonstrate how to train a SSD object detector using the Tensorflow Object Detection API which uses the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset. The detection result example is shown as below (the left part is detection result and the right part is ground truth annotation).
